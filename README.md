# EEG-microstate-validity
A MATLAB-based repository for the quantitative analysis of EEG microstates, with a focus on methodological rigor, reliability, and validity indicators. Microstates are represented as discrete classes using a one-hot encoding assumption â€” each time point is assigned to exactly one microstate. The repository includes methods for temporal segmentation, clustering, explained variance computation, transition analysis, and robustness testing. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the effects of preprocessing, clustering parameters, and the one-hot assumption itself on the stability and physiological interpretability of microstates.
